- Model for predicting output power:
    - This MLR model aims to predict the amount of power given the windspeed and the direction of the wind:

    - R^2 value can be summed up as: 
        - How good does our model fit the data
        - Represented as a value between 0, 1
        - Higher value -> better fit
        - .83 means out fit is GOOD
    - MSE value can be summed up as: 
        - Average difference between actual value and the predicted from the model - Sum of the average error 
        - ...more context is required to interpret this number in this situation

- Optimal wind speed and direction over one year period:
