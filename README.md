This is a study into the development of renewable energy and adoption patterns around the world. 

- The first part of my research looks into understand the adoption of renewable energy in: The United States, China, Russia, India, United Kingdom and Canada 
- Let's first understand the dataset: 
- understanding the data: 
    - Entity: is the name of the contry
    - Code: code for the country 
    - Year: year studied - Updated to 2021
    - Renewables (% equivalent primary energy): The value for this indicator represents the percentage of energy consumed from renewable sources relative to the total energy consumed from all sources

1) This graph represents the percentage of energy provided by renewable energy sources from 1966 to 2021.

- Interesting insights: 
    - Canada and India peaked much earlier than other countries
    - United kindgdom has has rapid growth from 2000 to 2021
    - Canada surpasses all countries in the % of energy provided by renewable sources

2) Biggest jump from year to year in each country:

    - Interesting insights: 
        - United Kingdoms lowest year to year usage of renewables came directly after the highest
