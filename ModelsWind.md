# Using modeling and machine learning into gaining insight into predicting optimal conditions, estimated power output

ESTIMATING OPTIMAL CONDITIONS: 

- Data collected from SCADA system in Turkey. Measurements were taken in 10-minute intervals. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset

- Description: 
    - Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals) - taken over one year 
    - LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
    - Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that the turbine uses for electricity generation)
    - Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
    - Wind Direction (°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automatically)
        - Wind turbine will automatically rotate in order to be in the direction to harvest the most amount of energy 
- Power produced vs wind speed:

    - looks similar to a Sigmoid distribution - this could be useful in prediction
    

- Power vs wind direction:

    - Not too many insights...high right skew just due to an abundance of data points at specific angles of the hub - visual is a little miss leading
    - To drive the point home - this is a plot of the frequency of the wind direction in the dataset:

     - The frequency of the angle of the hub is likely due to the weather patterns in the area. 



- Model for predicting output power:
    - This MLR model aims to predict the amount of power given the windspeed and the direction of the wind:

    - R^2 value can be summed up as: 
        - How well does our model fit the data
        - Represented as a value between 0, 1
        - Higher value -> better fit
        - .83 means our fit is GOOD
    - MSE value can be summed up as: 
        - Average difference between the actual value and the predicted from the model - Sum of the average error 
        - ...more context is required to interpret this number in this situation

- Using XGboost to predict theoretical energy output: 
    - Simply put, XGboost is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weaker classifers to create one stronger predictor. 
    - It's kinda like if you have a group of friends participating in a game show. You would want each person to be skilled in different areas to create the best team. 
    - In summary as shown in the MLR model, the expeceted amount of energy is super predictable, and the model was extremely accurate. 
    - When it comes to building machine learning models there are some features in the dataset that are more important than others: 
        - Here is the data for out dataset: 
            Wind Speed (m/s): 3280.0
            Date/Time: 241.0
            Wind Direction (°): 151.0
            LV ActivePower (kW): 135.0
        - We can say that wind speed is the work horse. We would be able to predict the theoretical power with only windspeed. 
        - The other features are important, but not nearly as much as wind speed. 
    - As discussed before we have R^2 and MSE values: 
        - Our R^2 was .99 and MSE was extremely low at 1.6
        - This indicates that our model is extremely powerful, but can also indicate a case of overfitting.
