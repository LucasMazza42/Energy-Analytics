# Introduction 

This part of the project is to help me understand how machine learning can apply to the solar energy sector. 

- The dataset works with sensor data and weather data to help understand how we can predict energy output, maintenance, and overall efficiency. 

- A huge resource for me was Ani Kannals notebook on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/code/elbiopea/solar-power-plant-time-series-analysis-v5-01-22/notebook
