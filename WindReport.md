    - GE is the top producer
    - AVG cost of wind turbine 2 to 4 million 


- Wind turbine statistics:
    - Costs are decreasing 
        - Source: https://meic.org/cost-of-wind-vs-fossil-fuels/
            - Wind turbine cost per megawatt-hour is between $32 and $62 
            - Coal cost per megawatt-hour is between $57 and $148 
    - Turbine capacity is increasing:

ESTIMATING OPTIMAL CONDITIONS: 

- Data collected from SCADA system in Turkey. Measurements were taken in 10 minute intervals. Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset

- Description: 
    - Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals) - taken over one year 
    - LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
    - Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
    - Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
    - Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)
        - Wind turbine will automatically rotate in order to be in the direction to harvest the most amount of energy 
- Power produced vs wind speed:

    - looks similar to a Sigmoid distiribtion - this could be useful in prediction
    

- Power vs wind direction: 
    - <img width="853" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-20 at 2 41 37 PM" src="https://github.com/LucasMazza42/RenewableEnergy/assets/47802441/886c90b3-d5ea-4b5f-852e-5c1c3cf6ea0d">
    - Not too many insights...high right skew just due to abundance of datapoints at specific angles of the hub - visual is a little miss leading
    - To drive the point home - this is a plot of the frequency of the wind direction in the dataset: 
        <img width="840" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-20 at 2 32 10 PM" src="https://github.com/LucasMazza42/RenewableEnergy/assets/47802441/51dbce6e-5240-4850-b8a1-aeb1f502d21c">
     - The frequency of the angle of the hub is likely due to the weather patterns in the area. 


- Model for predicting output power:
    - This MLR model aims to predict the amount of power given the windspeed and the direction of the wind:

    - R^2 value can be summed up as: 
        - How good does our model fit the data
        - Represented as a value between 0, 1
        - Higher value -> better fit
        - .83 means out fit is GOOD
    - MSE value can be summed up as: 
        - Average difference between actual value and the predicted from the model - Sum of the average error 
        - ...more context is required to interpret this number in this situation

- Optimal wind speed and direction over one year period:
