# RenewableEnergy
This is a study into the development of renewable energy and adoption patterns around the world. 

- The first part of my research looks into understand the adoption of renewable energy in: The United States, China, Russia, India, United Kingdom and Canada 
- Let's first understand the dataset: 
- understanding the data: 
    - Entity: is the name of the contry
    - Code: code for the country 
    - Year: year studied - Updated to 2021
    - Renewables (% equivalent primary energy): The value for this indicator represents the percentage of energy consumed from renewable sources relative to the total energy consumed from all sources

1) This graph represents the percentage of energy provided by renewable energy sources from 1966 to 2021.

- Interesting insights: 
    - Canada and India peaked much earlier than other countries
    - United kindgdom has has rapid growth from 2000 to 2021
    - Canada surpasses all countries in the % of energy provided by renewable sources

2) Biggest jump from year to year in each country:

   - Interesting insights: 
        - United kingdom has by far the biggest push in 2020 
        - All biggest jumps came in 2020 - interesting due to covid-19 happening at the same time. 
3) Smallest jump from year to year in each country:

    - Interesting insights: 
        - United Kingdoms lowest year to year usage of renewables came directly after the highest

Look into the amount of energy being provided in each country from year to year by each of the main sources of renewables: Wind, Solar, Geo Biomass, Hydro Generation: 

- WIND:

- SOLAR

- GEO BIOMASS:

4) Solar capacity in each country - the ability and amount of solar energy a country is able to store:

- Interesting insights: 
    - China makes a big effort to produce alot of energy through renewable efforts, but represented as a percentage of the total energy produced. It still is not as much as say Canada. 
    - China in every category is producing the most amount of total energy.


- Wind Turbine data in the USA: data source: https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/#keyValue

       - High concentration in central United States

- Age of manufacturing:
